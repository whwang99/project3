            <div>
              <p>
                Refik Anadol is a media artist and director born in Istanbul,
                Turkey in 1985. Currently lives and works in Los Angeles,
                California. He is a lecturer and visiting researcher in UCLA’s
                Department of Design Media Arts.
              </p>

              <p>
                He is working in the fields of site-specific public art with
                parametric data sculpture approach and live audio/visual
                performance with immersive installation approach, particularly
                his works explore the space among digital and physical entities
                by creating a hybrid relationship between architecture and media
                arts with machine intelligence. He holds a master of fine arts
                degree from University of California, Los Angeles in Media Arts,
                master of fine arts degree from Istanbul Bilgi University in
                Visual Communication Design as well as bachelors of arts degree
                with summa cum laude in Photography and Video.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a media artist, designer and spatial thinker, Refik Anadol is
                intrigued by the ways in which the transformation of the subject
                of contemporary culture requires rethinking of the new
                aesthetic, technique and dynamic perception of space. Anadol
                builds his works on the nomadic subject’s reaction to and
                interactions with unconventional spatial orientations with data
                and machine intelligence. Embedding media arts into
                architecture, he questions the possibility of a post digital
                architectural future in which there are no more non-digital
                realities. He invites the viewers to visualize alternative
                realities by presenting them the possibility of re-defining the
                functionalities of both interior and exterior architectural
                formations. Anadol’s work suggests that all spaces and facades
                have potentials to be utilized as the media artists’ canvases.
                Privileging difference rather than singularity and movement
                rather than stasis, Anadol faces all the new challenges that the
                gradual development of an enriched immersive environment and
                ubiquitous computing impose on architects, media artists and
                engineers.

                How is our experience of space changing, now that digital
                objects ranging from smart phones to urban screens have all but
                colonized our everyday lives? How have media technologies
                changed our conceptualizations of space, and how has
                architecture embraced these shifting conceptualizations? These
                are the three main questions that Anadol tackles by not simply
                integrating media into built forms, but by translating the logic
                of a new media technology into spatial design

                Studies. Carrie forges art that bridges the capabilities of
                computers and the creative touch of humans. Her humanities
                research explores turning complex works of human expression into
                numbers.

              How does knowledge grow? Sometimes it begins with one insight and
              grows into many branches. Infographics expert Manuel Lima explores
              the thousand-year history of mapping data — from languages to
              dynasties — using trees of information. It's a fascinating history
              of visualizations, and a look into humanity's urge to map what we
              know.

              Charts and graphs are the default for data analysis, but some data
              sets require a little more humanity. What do you call a hairpiece
              worn by a man? How southern was William Faulkner? Carrie Roy
              answers these questions and more though sculpture, woodwork, fiber
              arts, photography, and even virtual reality.
